Current implementations of the 2SFCA method are static in that they consider centroid-based night-time representations of the population. The proposed enhancement to the 2SFCA approach addresses this limitation by accounting for trip-chaining behavior. The presented method is illustrated in a case study of accessibility of daycare centers in the province East Flanders in Belgium. The results show significant spatial differences in accessibility between the original and commuter-based version of the 2SFCA (CB2SFCA). They highlight the importance of giving heed to more complex travel behavior in cases where the need for detailed accessibility calculations is apparent.},

	abstract = {Taking into account the rapidly aging demographic landscape in China, securing elderly's right to participate in society has become an urgent challenge. Geographical access to urban amenities is known to influence social participation and integration. However, the application of accessibility analysis to elderly population in China has received little attention to date. This study examines the walking accessibility to recreational amenities for older adults in the Chinese context with an explicit focus on equity. Building on empirically-based estimates of a cumulative opportunity approach, we calculate the levels of accessibility at the traffic analysis zone level, evaluate how accessibility varies across age cohorts, and present the distribution of accessibility across zones. To this end, we draw on the 2015 Nanjing Travel Survey and the city's {GIS} database. Instead of assuming a fixed threshold, this paper applies a spatial expansion model to allow for person- and location-specific walking distances to measure accessibility. The spatial disparities in access to recreational amenities are evaluated using the notion of vertical equity for identifying areas that are better-off or worse -off. Our results show pronounced distributional effects of current land-use and transportation policies for different age cohorts. In particular, elderly people experience lower accessibility to chess/card rooms and urban parks than their younger counterparts. The empirical evidence in this research can inform planning and policy interventions and feed current scientific debates on the role of accessibility in addressing social inclusion for an age-friendly society.},

The most common accessibility metric, the cumulative opportunity measure, is often computed as the number of jobs that can be reached within a certain time frame. Aggregating all jobs, however, often inﬂates the opportunities that can be reached by socially vulnerable residents, which could feed into and/or generate inadequate policy decisions. This study therefore develops the measure of accessibility to low-income jobs for vulnerable residents by public transport, speciﬁcally taking into account realized travel times by these vulnerable individuals. This ﬁne-grained measure, computed across 11 major Canadian cities, is a modiﬁed place-based accessibility metric that incorporates facets of person-based metrics, allowing planners and policy makers to propose more targeted interventions to improve the quality of life of their cities' most vulnerable populations. The study further allows for direct comparisons between the impacts of variation in accessibility levels between diﬀerent regions to help create best practices in land use and transport planning.},

This urban planning concept proposes a city where residents can meet their essential needs within a short walking or cycling trip from their home. Local access to grocery stores is a necessary component for cities to achieve the 15-minute city. This study aims to evaluate local accessibility to grocery stores by walking and cycling in the City of Vancouver. We used a cu­ mulative opportunity measure to count the number of grocery stores available within a 15-minute walk and cycle from people’s homes. To evaluate accessibility from the perspective of younger and older travellers, we considered different travel speeds. Our results show there is good accessibility to grocery stores when cycling, with less than 1\% of the city’s population not having a grocery store within a 15-minute cycle. When assuming a walking speed of an older pedestrian, around one-fifth of the population did not have access to a grocery store in their local area. The neighbourhoods that did not have a store within a 15-minute walk had higher proportions of children, older adults, and visible minorities, and lower rates of employment and post-secondary education attainment. In seeking to improve accessibility via walking and cycling, cities should prioritize grocery store locations and investments in pedestrian and cycling infrastructure to underserved neighbourhoods and populations.},

	abstract = {A transit system’s usefulness is governed by the freedom it provides to those who use it. This freedom, typically quantified as accessibility, is proportional to the amount and variety of destinations available to a potential transit user. Often, transit systems are designed with the commuter in mind; employment is a typical stand-in measure for all destinations when measuring accessibility in a city. This paper proposes a framework to “bundle” destination types into a more comprehensive profile of accessibility. The framework is flexible enough to adapt to local conditions and data availability, and provides a potential planner with the ability to tell a more nuanced story of transit accessibility in a city. Using population, employment, and crowd-sourced destination data in Calgary, Canada, we perform a comparison of destination bundling approach to find that the relative level of access to destinations varies greatly with the bundle of destinations used. We also analyze correlations be­ tween quality of access to destinations, suggesting that certain destinations can act as substitutes for others, and that using destinations with low correlations in their quality of access increases the results’ sensitivity to the transit network. As this approach uses open data sources available in most jurisdictions, it can be easily applied to different urban areas, destination sets, and accessibility measures to tell a more comprehensive story of transit accessibility in cities.},

This study presents a measure of local access to a wide range of non-work destinations, calibrated using data from Virginia. It focuses speciﬁcally on walking access as a proxy for multimodal accessibility and supportive land uses. The metric is intuitive, it can be calculated using available software and data, and it relates to important outcomes such as travel behavior and economic productivity. This work presents an opportunity for practitioners to incorporate accessibility metrics in various decision making applications and improve upon them as their knowledge and use of these metrics grow.},

	abstract = {Over the last two decades, a feminist critique of gender-blind transportation research and planning has generated a spate of research into ‘women and transport’. This article critically reviews this literature, and argues that it has come to focus on a relatively limited range of research problems (notably journey-to-work travel) at the expense of other relevant issues. An alternative approach is suggested which redefines the topic as ‘gender and daily mobility’ and incorporates it within a larger theoretical project investigating social and cultural geographies of mobility. Some areas of scholarship associated with the ‘cultural turn’ are explored to illustrate the potential for new approaches. The article then argues that future research on the topic must be based on a more systematic treatment of gender as a theoretical concept. A framework of analysis is outlined which identifies aspects of gender as a social category and symbolic code, and links it to aspects of daily mobility. The article outlines potential research questions identified through this analysis, and draws attention to a wide range of literature which may be brought to bear on the redefined topic area.},

	abstract = {Private vehicle travel entails costs to society. However, in a world designed around the automobile, adults who lack access to a vehicle for economic reasons may experience a significant handicap due to constrained mobility and accessibility. This paper examines whether private vehicle access is associated with the quantity and quality of out-of-home activities in which lowincome individuals participate. We use pooled data from multiple time use surveys drawn from the Netherlands, Canada, Spain, and the United Kingdom, and employ Cragg two-part hurdle modeling to determine whether there is an association between household vehicle access and participation in twelve out-of-home activity types. As a robustness check, we also estimate multiple discrete continuous extreme value ({MDCEV}) models. Further, we examine travel time by mode for those with and without vehicles. Finally, we use American Time Use Survey data and fixed-effects panel models to determine the subjective well-being that is associated with our outof-home activity types. A lack of private vehicle access is associated with significantly less frequent out-of-home activity participation, both in the aggregate and for seven of the twelve individual activities. Moreover, the activities most likely to be foregone are generally associated with high subjective well-being, suggesting that constrained mobility comes with significant emotional costs. We find a greater “activity penalty” for rural residents and for Canadian residents without vehicle access; urbanites without vehicles in the U.K. are the only geographic group which do not exhibit an activity penalty. Finally, respondents with vehicle access spend more total time traveling, although those without private vehicles partially offset spending less time in them with higher use of alternative modes. Overall, the findings suggest that the lack of a private vehicle is deleterious for quality of life, raising troubling questions about inequity possibly arising when people are denied access to vehicles for economic reasons.},

	abstract = {The integration of transport and land use planning is widely recognized as essential to the achievement of sustainable development. The concept of accessibility—or what and how can be reached from a given point in space—can provide a useful conceptual framework for this integration. More speciﬁcally, a shift of focus in urban transport planning from catering for mobility to catering for accessibility helps see how more sustainable transport options can, under certain land use conditions, provide a competitive degree of accessibility that matches less sustainable options. The authors have used the concept of accessibility as a framework for the interactive design of integrated transport and land use plans in two areas of the Netherlands. The objective of these exercises was identifying solutions where economic, social, and environmental goals could be combined, deﬁned as the achievement of ‘sustainable accessibility’. The existing situation has been evaluated, and alternative plans have been developed. In this paper we reﬂect on these experiences and sketch the way forward, with a focus on the methodological aspects of the undertaking. In this respect, a major challenge is ﬁnding a workable balance between an accessibility measure that is theoretically and empirically sound and one that is sufﬁciently plain to be usefully employed in interactive, creative plan-making processes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cost containment typically involves rationalizing healthcare service delivery through centralization of services to achieve economies of scale. Hospitals are frequently the chosen site of cost containment and rationalization especially in rural areas. Socio-demographic and geographic characteristics make hospital service allocation more difficult in rural and remote regions. This research presents a methodology to model rational catchments or service areas around rural hospitals--based on travel time. RESULTS: This research employs a vector-based GIS network analysis to model catchments that better represent access to hospital-based healthcare services in British Columbia's rural and remote areas. The tool permits modelling of alternate scenarios in which access to different baskets of services (e.g. rural maternity care or ICU) are assessed. In addition, estimates of the percentage of population that is served--or not served--within specified travel times are calculated. CONCLUSION: The modelling tool described is useful for defining true geographical catchments around rural hospitals as well as modelling the percentage of the population served within certain time guidelines (e.g. one hour) for specific health services. It is potentially valuable to policy makers and health services allocation specialists.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Greater travel time to cancer care has been identified as a potential barrier to care as well as associated with worse health outcomes. While rural cancer patients have been shown to travel farther for care, it is not known what patient, facility, and clinical characteristics may differentially be associated with greater roundtrip travel times for cancer patients by rurality of residence. Identifying these factors will help providers understand which patients may be most in need of resources to assist with travel. METHODS: Using 2010-2014 Pennsylvania Cancer Registry data, we examined the association between patient, facility, and clinical characteristics with roundtrip patient travel time using multivariate linear regression models. We then estimated separate models by rural residence based on the Rural-Urban Continuum Code (RUCC) of a patient's county of residence at diagnosis to understand how the association of each factor with travel time may vary for patients separated into metro residents (RUCC 1-3); and two categories of non-metro residents (RUCC 4-6) and (RUCC 7-9). RESULTS: In our sample (n = 197,498), we document large differences in mean roundtrip travel time-mean 41.5 min for RUCC 1-3 patients vs. 128.9 min for RUCC 7-9 patients. We show cervical/uterine and ovarian cancer patients travel significantly farther; as do patients traveling to higher volume and higher-ranked hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: To better understand patient travel burden, providers need to understand that factors predicting longer travel time may vary by rurality of patient residence and cancer type.},

   abstract = {Accessibility indicators are widely used in transportation, urban and healthcare planning, among many other applications. These measures are weighted sums of reachable opportunities from a given origin, conditional on the cost of movement, and are estimates of the potential for spatial interaction. Over time, various proposals have been forwarded to improve their interpretability: one of those methodological additions have been the introduction of competition. In this paper we focus on competition, but first demonstrate how a widely used measure of accessibility with congestion fails to properly match the opportunity-seeking population. We then propose an alternative formulation of accessibility with competition, a measure we call spatial availability. This measure relies on proportional allocation balancing factors (friction of distance and population competition) that are equivalent to imposing a single constraint on conventional gravity-based accessibility. In other words, the proportional allocation of opportunities results in a spatially available opportunities value which is assigned to each origin that, when all origin values are summed, equals the total number of opportunities in the region. We also demonstrate how Two-Stage Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA) methods are equivalent to spatial availability and can be reconceptualized as singly-constrained accessibility. To illustrate the application of spatial availability and compare it to other relevant measures, we use data from the 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey of the Greater Golden Horseshoe area in southern Ontario, Canada. Spatial availability is an important contribution since it clarifies the interpretation of accessibility with competition and paves the way for future applications in equity analysis (e.g., spatial mismatch, opportunity benchmarking, policy intervention scenario analysis).},

The principal component of ‘accessibility,’ proximity to opportunities, and availability of mobility are manipulated to obtain the accessibility measure of all the inhabited rural settlements and being aggregated at subsequent hierarchy levels sub-districts and districts, the basic planning and policymaking unit in the Indian context. District-level indicators of education and health validate the measure by multivariate stepwise regression analysis. The dis­ tribution pattern being analyzed spatially to rationalize the measure would capture and identify the gaps in the infrastructure. The measure is census-based, simple in terms of communicability, cost-effective, undemanding of data, and an effort towards addressing the magnitude of supply of opportunities based on physical planning criteria.},

Link as well as intersection stress is calculated to develop a citywide network of cycling stress. The cumulative opportunities reachable at four levels of cycling stress are calculated for each dissemination area in the city. The results show a low level of cycling access ({\textless} 5000 jobs) across most of the city at low levels of stress ({LTS} ≤ 2). Only at level of stress three, where cyclists may be required to negotiate with vehicles and may be in proximity of high-speed traﬃc, does cycling accessibility rise above 15,000 jobs for a sizeable section of the city. The link between low-stress access to jobs and the decision to cycle from home is investigated using a binary logit model. The results indicate that the cycling accessibly measure has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on choosing cycling as the travel mode with larger eﬀect for low-stress access. The low stress cycling accessibility to subway stations is calculated as an example of the practical applications of this method and illustrates the limited cycling access to many stations in the Toronto network. Further, a theoretical scenario analysis is undertaken comparing diﬀerent bicycle network scenarios. Three scenarios are tested 1) removing all cycle tracks, 2) upgrading all bike lanes to cycle tracks, and 3) decreasing street speeds by 10 km/h on the road network entire network. Scenario 3 in particular drastically increases cycling access to jobs.},

Cumulative measures are simple and easy to interpret, while gravity-based measures are more sophisticated, resourceful, and less intuitive ap­ proaches. As such, this study aims to investigate whether the estimates of a simple cumulative opportunity measure are significantly different from those made using advanced gravity-based measures to understand if the former can be a substitute for the latter in practice and if a certain threshold of travel time can be recommended for different regions. We estimated cumulative and gravity-based accessibility using decay-probability density functions, decay-cumulative density functions, Gaussian, and a Log-Logistic decay-cumulative density functions using census commuting flows, car congested travel time and public transit schedules from eight metropolitan regions across Canada – Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg, London, and Halifax. These measures of accessibility were tested for correlation, and we found that a coefficient of approximately 0.90 is reached when the threshold to calculate cumulative opportunities accessibility is set to the average commute time for both low- and non-low-wage jobs accessibility analyses by transit and motor vehicles. The paper pro­ vides evidence to support the reliability of cumulative accessibility, facilitates its broader adoption for evaluation of transport and land use interactions in North American cities, as well as opens opportunities to advance the equitable distribution of transport system benefits.},

Our objective in this paper is to conduct a review of various commonly used measures of accessibility, with a particular view to clarifying their normative (i.e. prescriptive), as well as positive (i.e. descriptive) aspects. This is a distinction that has seldom been made in the literature and that helps to better understand the meaning of alternative ways to implement the concept of accessibility. Our discussion of the positive and normative aspects of accessibility measurements is illustrated using the city of Montreal, Canada, as a case study. The example highlights the differences in the measured levels of accessibility depending on implementation. Comparison of the two by means of a relative indicator of accessibility helps to identify the gap between desired (as normative deﬁned) and actual (as revealed) accessibility levels.},

	abstract = {Place-based accessibility measures communicate the potential interaction with opportunities at a zone that populations can access. Recent research has explored the implications of how opportunities are counted by different accessibility methods. In conventional measures, opportunities are multiply counted if more than one zone offers access to the same opportunity. This multi-count of opportunities leads to values of accessibility that are difficult to interpret. A possible solution to enhance the meaning-making of accessibility results is by constraining the calculations to match a known quantity. This ensures all zonal values sum up to a predetermined quantity (i.e., the total number of opportunities). In this way, each value can be meaningfully related to this total. A recent effort that implements this solution is spatial availability, a singly-constrained accessibility measure. In this paper, we extend spatial availability for use in the case of multiple modes or more generally, heterogeneous population segments with distinct travel behaviors. After deriving a multimodal version of spatial availability, we proceed to illustrate its features using a synthetic example. We then apply it to an empirical example of low emission zones in Madrid, Spain. We conclude with suggestions for future research and its use in evaluating policy interventions.},

   abstract = {As cities expand, human mobility has become a central focus of urban planning and policy making to make cities more inclusive and sustainable. Initiatives such as the "15-minutes city" have been put in place to shift the attention from monocentric city configurations to polycentric structures, increasing the availability and diversity of local urban amenities. Ultimately they expect to increase local walkability and increase mobility within residential areas. While we know how urban amenities influence human mobility at the city level, little is known about spatial variations in this relationship. Here, we use mobile phone, census, and volunteered geographical data to measure geographic variations in the relationship between origin-destination flows and local urban accessibility in Barcelona. Using a Negative Binomial Geographically Weighted Regression model, we show that, globally, people tend to visit neighborhoods with better access to education and retail. Locally, these and other features change in sign and magnitude through the different neighborhoods of the city in ways that are not explained by administrative boundaries, and that provide deeper insights regarding urban characteristics such as rental prices. In conclusion, our work suggests that the qualities of a 15-minutes city can be measured at scale, delivering actionable insights on the polycentric structure of cities, and how people use and access this structure.},

However, this capitalisation of the benefits of accessibility could vary between different study areas. This research estimates hedonic and spatial hedonic models in two urban areas to compare if differences can be found in the impact accessibility using public transport has on residential property values. The two study areas chosen for comparison are a medium sized city without any major mobility problems (Santander, Spain) and a very large city with major congestion problems (Rome, Italy). The estimated hedonic models have considered the possible presence of spatial effects, a common occurrence with real estate data which may generate dependency in the residuals of hedonic models. Accessibility has been measured using two types of indicators: relative and gravity based. The results confirm that accessibility was a positive factor on property prices in both cities, although in Santander this was only true using the relative indicator to the city centre. These results are relevant for supporting the introduction of value capture policies which provide finance for new projects to extend and encourage greater use of public transport.},

	abstract = {Geographic variations in spatial accessibility to public resources, such as health care services, raise important questions about the efﬁciencies and inequities of the processes that determine where these services are located. Spatial accessibility can be measured many different ways, but many of methods in use today involve some measure of travel cost (in time or distance). In this study we explore a simple methodological question: how much are models of spatial accessibility inﬂuenced by the precise metric of travel cost? We address this question by comparing spatial accessibility to primary care physicians for two different methods of calculating travel cost (in time) on a street network: free-ﬂow travel time and congested with turn penalties travel timedwhich augments free-ﬂow travel times with the burden of trafﬁc congestion and trafﬁc intersection controls. We consider the effect of these two metrics of travel cost on a gravity-based measure of spatial accessibility to primary health care services in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Our results suggest that while travel times between locations of demand and locations of primary care providers greatly differ based on how travel cost is calculated, the gravity-based measure of spatial accessibility provides similar information for both travel cost metrics. Using congested with turn penalties travel time can be an onerous addition to the analysis of spatial accessibility, and is more useful for measuring absolute travel time rather than modeling relative spatial accessibility.},

We find that car ownership transitions are primarily motivated by economic security and insecurity. The median length of a car-less episode is 1.7 years, while black and Hispanic respondents experienced longer car-less episodes. Despite their precarious grasp on car ownership, respondents felt that owning a car was worth it.},

	abstract = {As healthcare is a right in Canada, analyzing the distribution of spatial access to medical consultations, which are crucial for the prevention, diagnosis, and early treatment of illnesses, is fundamental to understanding health equity. Spatial accessibility can influence whether individuals can reasonably reach the services they seek. However, as an indicator of potential access, it does not guarantee realized access because of predisposing and need factors. This study examines the relationship between spatial accessibility to hospitals and the likelihood of consulting with a healthcare professional at a hospital in eight Canadian metropolitan regions while controlling for individual characteristics through multilevel regression modeling. Spatial accessibility was computed using the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method. Self-reported consultations and socio-demographic characteristics were obtained from the Canadian Community Health Survey. We found that the likelihood of consultations differed between genders (female {OR}: 1.133, {CI}: 1.023-1.255; compared with male) and followed a positive household income gradient (high-income {OR}: 1.236, {CI}: 1.094-1.397; middle-income {OR}: 1.039, {CI}: 0.922-1.172; compared with low-income), but is not influenced by age. Living in areas with higher spatial accessibility was positively linked to consultations ({OR}: 1.014, {CI}: 1.000-1.028), even after controlling for perceived health ({OR}: 0.540, {CI}: 0.471-0.621), chronic conditions ({OR}: 1.738, {CI}: 1.587-1.904), and having a regular doctor ({OR}: 1.313, {CI}: 1.187-1.452). Policies that may improve spatial accessibility to healthcare services through increasing supply, managing demand, and enhancing level of public transport service should be considered to improve individuals' ability to consult healthcare professionals, potentially leading to better health outcomes.},

Multinomial logistic regression shows that baseline access to automobiles has a strong positive relationship to follow-up employment but public transit access and receipt of housing assistance do not. Our findings suggest that enhancing car access will notably improve employment outcomes among very-low-income adults, but other assistance will have, at best, marginal effects.},

	abstract = {In recent years the literature on mobility of care has rapidly expanded, and the concept offers a powerful lens to highlight how everyday mobilities are organised, undertaken, and experienced in gendered ways. The concept can nonetheless benefit from further theoretical development. In this paper we enrich the mobility of care concept by drawing on influential conceptualisations of care from feminist theory and analysis of data collected during the {COVID}-19 lockdown among a group of 40 low-income women living in peri-urban areas of Itagüí, a municipality in the south of the Medellín metropolitan area, Colombia. Through this approach we first argue that relying on a taxonomy of trip purposes limits the understanding of the role of care in urban mobilities and risks underestimating the prevalence of mobility of care. Second, we suggest that activities of self-care also generate mobility of care and that their consideration allows practices and experiences of receiving care to be considered. Finally, we show how care activities are part of, and generate, intertwined mobilities and immobilities, and argue that rendering visible the full extent of mobilities of care demands that careful consideration be given to im­ mobilities as well.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, chrono-urbanism has welcomed a novel perspective, namely, that of the 15-minute city concept, which has recently emerged in the present planning debate. During the current pandemic, this has coincided with a drive to highlight the importance of merging more activities in the neighbourhood to improve urban vitality and reduce daily commuting. In addition, increasing digitalization and knowledge-intensive activities have transformed the nature of work itself, thus affecting the choice of the workplace with new working spaces ({NWS}) emerging for collaborative and flexible work environments. Therefore, within this context, this study discusses recent chrono-urbanism approaches applied to urban planning and the role of {NWS}. The phenomenon is empirically examined in Oslo and Lisbon through a qualitative analysis of planning documents and a spatial analysis. The results show that most {NWS} are fairly accessible by public transport to users in both cities; although the {NWS} neighbourhoods in Lisbon have a greater diversity of functions compared to Oslo. However, in both cities, the distribution of {NWS} is non-uniform. This may limit residents’ choice to live and work (outside home) in the same neighbourhood. The study contributes to the current planning debate on new urban models for sustainable neighbourhoods.},
